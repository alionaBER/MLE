# MLE

This Shiny app is designed to fit different distributions to data. There are two datasets with a few variables. Both probability mass and
cumulative distribution functions are plotted. 
The user can fit different distributions to decide which one is appropriate for maximum likelihood parameter estimation.

The app can be run with the following command:
```{r}
shiny::runGitHub('MLE', 'alionaBER')
```
